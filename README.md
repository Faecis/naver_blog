# Naver Blog

Collection of code I wrote for my [Naver blog](https://blog.naver.com/mathematica_faecis) articles.

## Branch Conventions

When writing code for a new article, create a separate branch and directory for it.
Initially, name the branch and directory to reflect the topic of the article.
After the article is published, obtain its ID and rename both the branch and directory to match this ID.
A pull request should be created to merge this branch to the main branch.
Once the branch is fully merged into the main branch, the branch must be deleted.
In case of the article is revoked, the corresponding branch must be deleted as well.

## Contribution

Although this repository is primarily for personal use, contributions are always welcome.
The most appreciated contributions include (but are not limited to) correcting any mistakes in the code.
Please feel free to share your suggestions via the [issues](https://github.com/Faecis/naver_blog/issues) page.
